    "1. Tích hợp công cụ tìm kiếm web: <br>\n",

    " **Explanation of the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mục đích của Code**\n",
    "   - Đoạn code này định nghĩa một node công cụ (`BasicToolNode`) thực thi động các công cụ dựa trên hướng dẫn từ tin nhắn gần đây nhất trong danh sách đầu vào.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cách thức hoạt động**\n",
    "   - **Khởi tạo (`__init__`)**:\n",
    "     - Một danh sách các công cụ được truyền cho constructor của `BasicToolNode`.\n",
    "     - Mỗi công cụ được lưu trữ trong một dictionary để tra cứu nhanh theo tên.\n",
    "   - **Thực thi (`__call__`)**:\n",
    "     - Khi node được gọi, nó xem xét tin nhắn gần đây nhất trong đầu vào được cung cấp (khóa `messages`).\n",
    "     - Nó trích xuất các lệnh gọi công cụ từ tin nhắn và gọi các công cụ thích hợp bằng tên và đối số của chúng.\n",
    "     - Kết quả được định dạng dưới dạng các đối tượng `ToolMessage` và được trả về.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ToolMessage**\n",
    "   - `ToolMessage` là một cách tiêu chuẩn hóa để lưu trữ và trả về kết quả thực thi công cụ, bao gồm tên công cụ, nội dung kết quả và ID duy nhất cho lệnh gọi công cụ.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Thêm vào Đồ thị**\n",
    "   - Node công cụ (`tool_node`) được thêm vào đồ thị bằng cách sử dụng `graph_builder.add_node`. Điều này tích hợp node vào một quy trình làm việc hoặc pipeline thực thi lớn hơn.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sử dụng**\n",
    "   - Cấu trúc này thường là một phần của hệ thống lớn hơn, nơi các công cụ được gọi dựa trên đầu vào của người dùng hoặc logic hệ thống, và kết quả được trả về cho người dùng hoặc chuyển đến các node khác.\n"
